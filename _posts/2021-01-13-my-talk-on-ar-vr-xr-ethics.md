I was invited to speak at the second [JHU/APL XR
Symposium](https://www.jhuapl.edu/xr21) on something.  When I pitched
the ethics of augmented reality and virtual reality, I had no idea
what I was getting into.  This is a rich topic area and has only
lightly been explored.  This is going to be a huge problem as the
technologies become further mainstream.
