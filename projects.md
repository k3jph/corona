for the Coursera Internet of Things capstone course.

## Danish Language Resources

[_Danish Language Resources_](/dansk) is an interactive document
that collects resources for English speakers who are learning the
Danish language.  I started learning
[Danish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language) through
[Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) in December 2014. This document
exists to collect resources from around the Internet, principally
YouTube, to help students learning Danish and provide a catalog for
my own use.  Please feel free to suggest additional material.

## Swedish Language Resources

[_Swedish Language Resources_](/svenska) is an interactive document
that collects resources for English speakers who are learning the
Swedish language. This page exists to collect resources from around
the Internet, principally YouTube, to help students learning Danish
and provide a catalog for my own use.
