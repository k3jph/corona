My dissertation research focused on the policy, economic, and social
effects of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Flood
Mitigation Assistance (FMA) programs. The NFIP is a $1 trillion
Federal insurance program that provides flood insurance in the
United States, where private flood insurance is rarely available.
The NFIP itself is subject to risk from extreme weather and global
climate change. Because the NFIP is a government program, it is
ripe for policy, economic, and social welfare analysis.

> The best thing about being a statistician is that you get
> to play in everyone's backyard. <cite>-- John W. Tukey</cite>

Today, I extend those core methods across science, policy, and
technology. Understanding risk and predicting outcomes are critical
for public safety and national security and I am fortunate to play
in everyone else’s backyard. My research is largely driven by the
needs of those around me. I apply statistical methods in areas as
diverse as public health, global security, and space science. My
most recent published scholarship has modeled the population of
Earth-orbiting satellites, analyzed the risks of flood insurance,
predicted disruptive events, and sought to understand small business
cybersecurity. I have written two books on my work and have edited
two more.
