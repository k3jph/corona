This project provides a simple environment for modeling an artificial life construct called the _Virtual Bumblebees_.  The _Virtual Bumblebees_ is a two-dimensional cellular automaton where the full board updates each time step based on the prior board state and a limited list of rules.

Artificial life uses information concepts and computer modeling to study life in general, and terrestrial life in particular.  It aims to explain particular vital phenomena, ranging from the origin of biochemical metabolisms to the coevolution of behavioral strategies, and also the abstract properties of life as such (“life as it could be”).  In the case of the _Virtual Bumblebees_, it is a cellular automaton, the most famous of which is Conway's "Game of Life," first made popular by [Gardner](http://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf).
