FreeGrep was developed primarily over the summer of 1999 as a BSD-licensed alternative to GNU Grep provided with [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/). This edition of grep relies on the local regular express (regex) facilities and provides services for searching compressed archives.

During the summer of 2003, the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) Project replaced the GNU Grep shipping with OpenBSD with a heavily modified version of FreeGrep. This is the version of grep shipped with OpenBSD 3.4 and later. During the spring of 2004, the [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/) project replaced GNU Grep with a modified version of OpenBSD's FreeGrep and ships will NetBSD 2.0 and later.  Since then, it has shipped with [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/), [Minix](http://www.minix3.org/), FreeBSD, and many other operating systems.  

As these systems have incorporated FreeGrep, there is unlikely to be substantial new development in the main codebase.
