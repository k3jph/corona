I am a scientist at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/). Previously, I have been a
consultant to numerous government agencies, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the President, and
the United States Department of Homeland Security, and worked for
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as an internal
consultant on scientific computing. I am a passionate educator,
teaching mathematics and statistics at the University of Maryland
Global Campus since 2010 and have taught public affairs at [Baruch
College](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/jameshoward/), [Central
Michigan University](https://blogs.cmich.edu/howarjp1/), [Penn
State](https://sites.psu.edu/jameshoward/), and the University of
Baltimore.

I am fortunate to [play in everyone else's backyard](/scholarship).
My most recent work has modeled the spread of infectious respiratory
diseases and Ebolavirus, predicted global disruptive events,
researched using blockchain for government services, and created
devices for rescuing victims of building collapse. I have written [two
books](/books/) on my work and co-edited two more.

In my spare time, I have served Howard County, Maryland, as [a
member of the Board of Appeals](/service/howard-county/) and Charter
Review Commission and the [Watershed Stewards Academy Advisory
Committee](http://howardwsa.org/) of the [University of Maryland
Extension](https://extension.umd.edu/howard-county). Prior volunteer
experience also includes providing economic advice to the [Columbia
Association](http://www.columbiaassociation.com/), establishing an
alumni association for the [College Park Scholars
Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland,
and serving on numerous public and private volunteer advisory boards.
