I am a scientist at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/). Previously, I have been a consultant to numerous government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the President, and the United States Department of Homeland Security, and worked for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as an internal consultant on scientific computing. I am a passionate educator, teaching mathematics and statistics at the [University of Maryland Global Campus](http://www.umuc.edu/) since 2010 and have taught public management at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/), [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), and the [University of Baltimore](http://www.ubalt.edu/).

I am fortunate to [play in everyone else's backyard](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html). My most recent work has modeled the spread of infectious respiratory diseases and Ebolavirus, predicted global disruptive events, researched using blockchain for government services, and created devices for rescuing victims of building collapse. I have written [two books](/books/) on my work and co-edited two more.

In my spare time, I serve Howard County, Maryland, as [a member of the Board of Appeals](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals) and [Charter Review Commission](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/About-Us/Commissions-Task-Forces-and-Special-Reports/Charter-Review-Commission-2019-2020) and the [Watershed Stewards Academy Advisory Committee](http://howardwsa.org/) of the [University of Maryland Extension](https://extension.umd.edu/howard-county). Prior volunteer experience includes providing economic advice to the [Columbia Association](http://www.columbiaassociation.com/), establishing an alumni association for the [College Park Scholars Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, and serving on numerous public and private volunteer advisory boards.
